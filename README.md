# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Project-Data-Mining
This is my Data Mining Project.

Hello Connections, 👋

I’m excited to share my latest Data Science & Machine Learning project — Predicting Airline Passenger Satisfaction — where I built a real-time predictive system to identify at-risk passengers before dissatisfaction turns into churn or negative reviews.



🔍 Project Highlights

Two Pipelines:

Python (Jupyter Notebook) – Detailed EDA, feature engineering, model training & evaluation

RapidMiner (Auto Model) – No-code, audit-friendly, deployment-ready approach

Dataset: 103,904 passenger survey records, 23 fields (service ratings, flight details, demographics)

Key Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Naïve Bayes



📊 Results that Matter

Python – Random Forest: Accuracy ~89.4%, ROC AUC ~0.97, Recall (Dissatisfied) ~0.89

RapidMiner – Gradient Boosted Trees: Accuracy ~95.5%, strong AUC and balanced precision/recall

Top Drivers: Online boarding UX, In-flight entertainment/Wi-Fi, Travel class, Arrival delays



💼 Business Impact

Proactive Customer Recovery – Identify unhappy passengers early and engage with targeted actions

Improved NPS & Retention – Reduce churn, enhance service quality, and boost brand loyalty

Operational Readiness – Sub-second scoring in CRM, quarterly retraining, and bias checks



🛠 Tech Stack

 Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, RapidMiner

If you’re an HR, recruiter, manager, or business leader looking for someone who can turn data into business impact, I’d be happy to connect.
